# basic-portfolio
This is my first main attempt at creating multiple webpages in html and css. It was much more time-consuming than anticipated, and as such I was unable to complete all design aspects before the due date. However, the about page and contact page are complete, with a few improvements that could be added to the content page. The about me shows some of my academic pursuits as well as hobbies. The contact page is a simple contact form. The porfolio page is incomplete, but it was getting there. This will definitely motivate my time-management with regarding future assignments. Thank you.
